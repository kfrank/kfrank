### üëã Hi, I'm Klare

I lead the Enterprise design team here at GitHub.

- Sometimes I tweet about design and life [@klare](https://www.twitter.com/klare).
- Previously, I led design at [CodePen](https://www.codepen.io).
- I have a lot of creative hobbies, like making [abstract art](https://wsartwalk.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/klare_frank1.jpg?w=768), tailoring my clothes, and coming up with new [recipes](https://github.com/kfrank/recipes).
